# Example Blog Posts

This folder contains example blog posts from the original template. These are kept as references for creating your own blog posts.

## Files:

- **draft-post.md** - Example of a draft post (won't be published)
- **long-title.md** - Example with a long title
- **missing-content.md** - Minimal post example
- **social-image.md** - Example with social media image configuration
- **unique-tags.md** - Example showing how to use tags
- **cover-image/** - Example post with a cover image
- **markdown-elements/** - Comprehensive example showing all Markdown formatting options

## How to Use:

1. Copy any of these files to `src/content/post/` when you want to create a new post
2. Update the frontmatter (title, description, publishDate, tags, etc.)
3. Replace the content with your own
4. Remove the `draft: true` line to publish

## Frontmatter Reference:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description (50-160 characters)"
publishDate: "16 Nov 2025"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
draft: false  # Set to true to keep as draft

```
